This plugin gives you the ability to display the weather data provided by your Netatmo weather station on your Wordpress website.

== Description ==

FEATURES:
This plugin gives you the ability to display the weather data provided by your Netatmo weather station on your Wordpress website.

In particular:

- No coding required: you just need to login with your Netatmo account and this plugin will take care of everything else. It will search for every station and module you have associated with your account and display their data, along with the shortcodes needed to show that data on your website.

- Caching system: the plugin will save on your DB the data retrieved from Netatmo's servers. They will be refreshed every 5 minutes, so your site will remain super fast obtaining needed data locally on your server.
You can choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for measuring temperature and between hPa and mmHg for measuring the pressure.

- Your weather data will remain stored in your WordPress database forever, but you can delete all the measurements clicking the "Clear DB cache" button in the settings page.

- You can format shortcode generated values as you want.
